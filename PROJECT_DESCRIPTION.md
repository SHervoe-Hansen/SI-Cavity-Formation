# Project Description for Student Project
## Introduction

Early theories attempting to explain the Hofmeister series focused on the chaotropic and kosmotropic properties of salt. In specific it has been observed that salts up to a concentration of approximately 1 M can either linearly increase or decrease the viscosity of water depending on which salt is solubilized in the water. This effect is well described by the Jones-Dole equation and has for a long time been the experimental basis for the chaotropic and kosmotropic properties of salt. Today the hypothesis of salt being either chaotropic or kosmotropic is being weakened by the increasing amount of experimental and computational evidence which seems to suggest that salt does not perturb water beyond the local domain of salt. Instead, recent theories focus on the binding of salt to the surface of solutes and in doing so increases the solubility of the solute. These effects are, however, only limited to effects occurring at full interaction coupling between the solute and the solvent (λ=1) and thus do not explain a full solvation process. In the calculation of solvation free energies, we see that salts play a substantial role with some salts being able to increase the solvation free energy and other salts decreasing the solvation free energy. In specific we for example know that salt-specific effects are present within the high energy regime of the pair-energy coordinate which is associated with excluded volume effects and not present within the state of λ=1. This project seeks to find an explanation that can unify the experimental and computational observations into a single coherent theory in an attempt to finally understand the mechanism regarding the chaotropic and kosmotropic properties of salt (if existing) and more broadly the perturbation of solutes by salts.

To investigate what has been mentioned above the student would be using a combination of molecular simulations, statistical thermodynamics, and model creation. Supervision would be conducted by Stefan Hervø-Hansen and Prof. Nobuyuki Matubayasi. Due to Stefan being of foreign nationality, the possibility for improvement in English is also an opportunity. Finally, because of the novelty of the research, a high chance of publication will be possible.

## Research Milestones
1. The local domain of salts (the region in which the ion-salt RDF is not unity) can accumulate or dissipate water per unit volume compared to water itself.
2. Water perturbed by solute beyond the local domain of salts yields zero contribution to the difference in excluded volume contribution between water and salt solutions (under dilute conditions)
3. An analytical model should be possible to construct for simple systems.
4. Apply the analytical model + the knowledge gained from the first two points to predict the solvation hydrophobic compounds in water and salt solutions (possible solute candidates listed in Ref. 6). The predictions will be followed by molecular dynamics simulations and comparison to experimental data.
